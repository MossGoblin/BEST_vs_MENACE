Class Cell - only state
Class Board - has a grid of Cells
 -- can set and get Cell states
 -- can calculate Line sums
 -- can set produce board state identity


 Hm... what about a Board and a Cell classes, used both by Beast and Menace
 AND static classes who use them trough the switchboard (Main) ??
 that would get rid of the boardID !!

 !! On second thought... Do I need a Cell class at all? !!
 * Let's try without the Cell class

 REDOING BOARD
 FIGURING HOW TO MARK THE BOARD STATE IN THE MENACE BOARD THE EASIEST - shall I calculate board name from the boardID (good memorywise)
