Class Cell - only state
Class Board - has a grid of Cells
 -- can set and get Cell states
 -- can calculate Line sums
 -- can set produce board state identity


 Hm... what about a Board and a Cell classes, used both by Beast and Menace
 AND static classes who use them trough the switchboard (Main) ??
 that would get rid of the boardID !!
