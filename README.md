# BEST_vs_MENACE (C#)
A tic-tac-toe machine learning project

// For the moment there will be only notes
// BEAST will be something similar to https://github.com/MossGoblin/tictactoe_beast -- most likely the only difference will be that I'll reqrite it as OOP and some minor changes in the rules themselves (the implementation of the rules -- i.e. line checks --  will likely remain as it is)
// MENACE will use an old idea I found on Numberphile(@youtube)

// TODO : NEXT
// list requirements for each of the two system - native and cross
