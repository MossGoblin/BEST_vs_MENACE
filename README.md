# BEST_vs_MENACE (C#)
A tic-tac-toe machine learning project

___For the moment there will be only notes___
* BEAST will be something similar to https://github.com/MossGoblin/tictactoe_beast -- most likely the only difference will be that I'll rewrite it as OOP and some minor changes in the rules themselves (the implementation of the rules -- i.e. line checks --  will likely remain as it is)
* MENACE will use an old idea I found on Numberphile(@youtube)

__// ChangeLog__
_1.0_
* Switched the vessel (object transferring the moves between Beast and Menace) to int[] (boardID is a fancy idea that is too complicated for this case; will use it for something else)
__// TODO : NEXT__
* decide on a final GamePlan for Beast - revice the old one
